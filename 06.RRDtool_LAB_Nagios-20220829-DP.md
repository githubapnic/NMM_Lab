# LAB: RRDTool Lab - Nagios


#### Please follow the lab guide to login to the VM.
<br>
**Note:**  

* Commands preceded with `$` imply that you should execute the command as a general user - not as root.
* Commands preceded with `#` imply that you should be working as root.
* If a command line ends with `\` this indicates that the command continues on the next line and you should treat this as a single line.
<br>
<br>

**1. Install Required Packages**  

Update the package index for the APT package manager and install necessary packages:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install -y wget apache2-utils unzip curl openssl build-essential \
libgd-dev libssl-dev php8.1 php8.1-fpm fcgiwrap php8.1-gd 
```
**2. Downloading the source**  

With the prerequisites installed, we can install Nagios itself. Download the source code for the latest stable release of Nagios Core.
```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ wget https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.4.6.tar.gz
$ sudo tar xzf nagioscore.tar.gz
```

**3. Compile source and install Nagios**  

Before building Nagios, run the configure script and compile the components:
```bash
$ cd /tmp/nagioscore-nagios-4.4.5/
$ sudo ./configure
$ sudo make all
$ sudo make install-group-users
$ sudo usermod -aG nagios www-data
$ sudo make all
$ sudo make install-init
$ sudo make install-commandmode
$ sudo make install-config
```

_**You will see some warnings.** as long as everything compiles fine, we are good to proceed_

**4. Configure NGINX**

Create a file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` with an editor of your choice

```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/nagios

```
And Paste the following into the file being sure to replace your server name.

_**Please also note the change in port number**_

```bash
server {
    server_name     172.18.X.X;
    root            /usr/local/nagios/share;
    listen          83;
    index           index.php index.html index.htm;
    access_log      /var/log/nginx/nagios.access.log;
    error_log       /var/log/nginx/nagios.error.log;
    auth_basic            "Nagios Access";
    auth_basic_user_file  /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users;
    # Fixes frames not working
    add_header X-Frame-Options "ALLOW";
    location ~ \.php$ {
        try_files       $uri = 404;
        fastcgi_index   index.php;
        fastcgi_pass    unix:/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
        include         fastcgi.conf;
    }
    location ~ \.cgi$ {
        root            /usr/local/nagios/sbin;
        rewrite         ^/nagios/cgi-bin/(.*)\.cgi /$1.cgi break;
        fastcgi_param   AUTH_USER $remote_user;
        fastcgi_param   REMOTE_USER $remote_user;
        include         fastcgi.conf;
        fastcgi_pass    unix:/run/fcgiwrap.socket;
    }
    # Fixes the fact some links are expected to resolve to /nagios, see here.
    location /nagios {
        alias /usr/local/nagios/share;
    }
}
```

Now lets symlink /etc/nginx/sites-available/nagios to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/nagios and restart Nginx

```bash
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nagios /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/nagios
$ sudo systemctl reload nginx
```


**5. Create a user for the Nagios Web Portal**
Please enter `training` as password at the prompt. Remember this password, as we will need it to access the Nagios web interface.
```bash
$ sudo htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
```

When connecting to the web interface you will be prompted for a username and password. The username is `nagiosadmin` and the password is `training`


We have only installed the Nagios Core engine. But for this to work, it is necessary to install the Nagios Plugins, which you’ll cover in the next step.

**6. Installing the Nagios Plugins**  

Nagios needs plugins to operate properly. The official Nagios Plugins package contains over 50 plugins that allow you to monitor basic services such as uptime, disk usage, swap usage, NTP, and others.

Download and extract the archive
```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ wget https://nagios-plugins.org/download/nagios-plugins-2.3.3.tar.gz
```
Compile and install:
```bash
$ tar zxfv nagios-plugins-2.3.3.tar.gz
$ cd /tmp/nagios-plugins-2.3.3
$ sudo ./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios
$ sudo make
$ sudo make install
```

Now we can Verify the installation of Nagios
```bash
$ sudo /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
```
If Nagios has installed correctly you should see output similar to the below:

Now start and enable the `nagios` service
```bash
$ sudo systemctl start nagios
$ sudo systemctl enable nagios
```

**7. Web Interface**

Before we access the Web interface, we need to make 1 more change.
Edit the file `usr/local/nagios/etc/cgi.cfg`
```bash
$ sudo vi usr/local/nagios/etc/cgi.cfg
```
and we need to change the line<BR>
`url html path=/nagios` _to_<BR>
`url html path=/`

and then restart Nagios one more time:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl reload nagios
```


Point your web browser to the ip address or FQDN of your Nagios Core server, for example:

`http://172.18.X.X:83/`

Go to a host and check the status of `localhost`.

**8. Configuring Nagios**    

Now let’s perform the initial Nagios configuration, which involves editing some configuration files.

Open the main Nagios configuration file and find the line `#cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers`
```bash
$ sudo vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
```
Uncomment this line by deleting the # character from the front of the line:
```bash
cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers
```

also uncomment the line <BR>
`#cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/routers`

Now create the directory that will store the configuration file for each server that you will monitor:
```bash
$ sudo mkdir /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers
$ sudo mkdir /usr/local/nagios/etc/routers
```


**9. Monitoring Hosts with Nagios**  

To monitor any hosts with Nagios, we will add configuration files for each host specifying what we want to monitor.

On the Nagios server, create a new configuration file for each of the remote hosts that we want to monitor in `/usr/local/nagios/etc/routers/`. The following example is to monitor `core-router.apnictraining.net`

```bash
$ sudo vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/routers/core-router.cfg
```
Add the following host definition:
```bash
define host {
        use                             generic-host
        host_name                       core-router
        alias                           core-router
        address                         core-router.apnictraining.net
        check_command                   check-host-alive
        max_check_attempts              5
        check_period                    24x7
        notification_interval           30
        notification_period             24x7
}
```
Restart the Nagios service to put any changes into effect:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart nagios
```

After several minutes, Nagios will check the new hosts.

Lets add few more nodes and start monitoring them.

Following configuration is for `core-switch`:  
```
$ sudo vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/core-switch.cfg
```
```bash    
define host {
        use                             generic-host
        host_name                       core-switch
        alias                           core-switch
        address                         core-switch.apnictraining.net
        check_command                   check-host-alive
        max_check_attempts              5
        check_period                    24x7
        notification_interval           30
        notification_period             24x7
}
```

Now add your group router `groupX-router`. Replace `X` with group number:
```bash
$ sudo vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/routers/groupX-router.cfg
```
```bash    
define host {
        use                             generic-host
        host_name                       groupX-router
        alias                           groupX-router
        address                         groupX-router.apnictraining.net
        check_command                   check-host-alive
        max_check_attempts              5
        check_period                    24x7
        notification_interval           30
        notification_period             24x7
}
```
Restart the Nagios service to put any changes into effect:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart nagios
```

Go to Nagios web interface and validate.

**10. Monitoring Services with Nagios**  

In previous step we have configured Nagios to monitor the uptime. Nagios will only tell if the host is up or down. Let’s add some services to monitor.

Following configuration is to monitor `group1-server.apnictraining.net` HTTP service:
```bash
$ sudo vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/group1-server.cfg
```

Add the following host definition:
```bash
define host {
    use         generic-host
    host_name   group1-server
    alias       group1-server
    address     group1-server.apnictraining.net
    check_command                   check-host-alive
    max_check_attempts              5
    check_period                    24x7
    notification_interval           30
    notification_period             24x7
}

define service {
    use                 generic-service
    host_name           group1-server
    service_description HTTP
    check_command       check_http
}
```

The use `generic-service` directive tells Nagios to inherit the values of a service template called `generic-service`, which is predefined by Nagios.

Restart the Nagios service to put any changes into effect:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart nagios
```

From Nagios web interface go to `Services` tab and verify.

We can add other hosts (servers and routers) and start monitoring them.

**11. Adding Parent Relationships**  

The keyword `parents` define the parent-child relationship between nodes. For example as per our lab topology below is the connectivity diagram:  
```
    groupX-server -> groupX-router -> core-switch -> core-router
```

Where `core-router` is parent of `core-switch` and `core-switch` is parent of `groupX-router`

We can update our nodes configuration accordingly.

`core-switch.cfg`:
```bash
define host {
        use                             generic-host
        host_name                       core-switch
        alias                           core-switch
        address                         core-switch.apnictraining.net
        check_command                   check-host-alive
        max_check_attempts              5
        check_period                    24x7
        notification_interval           30
        notification_period             24x7
        parents                         core-router
}
```

`groupX-router.cfg` [replace X with group number]:

```bash
define host {
        use                             generic-host
        host_name                       groupX-router
        alias                           groupX-router
        address                         groupX-router.apnictraining.net
        check_command                   check-host-alive
        max_check_attempts              5
        check_period                    24x7
        notification_interval           30
        notification_period             24x7
        parents                         core-switch
}
```

`groupX-server.cfg` [replace X with group number]:

```bash
define host {
        use                             generic-host
        host_name                       groupX-server
        alias                           groupX-server
        address                         groupX-server.apnictraining.net
        check_command                   check-host-alive
        max_check_attempts              5
        check_period                    24x7
        notification_interval           30
        notification_period             24x7
        parents                         core-switch
}
```

Restart the Nagios service to put any changes into effect:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart nagios
```
Please confirm `nagios` has been loaded properly.
```bash
$ sudo systemctl status nagios
```
If `nagios` service is broken please check `/usr/local/nagios/var/nagios.log` for more details.

From Nagios web interface go to `Map` tab and verify.

Clean up after our installs
```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ sudo rm -rf *
```

**End of Lab**
