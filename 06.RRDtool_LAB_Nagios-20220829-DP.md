**Note:**  

* Commands preceded with `$` imply that you should execute the command as a general user - not as root.
* Commands preceded with `#` imply that you should be working as root.
* If a command line ends with `\` this indicates that the command continues on the next line and you should treat this as a single line.
<br>
<br>

**1. Install Required Packages**  

Update the package index for the APT package manager and install necessary packages:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install -y autoconf gcc libc6 make wget unzip apache2 php \
    libapache2-mod-php7.2 libgd-dev libmcrypt-dev libssl-dev bc \
    gawk dc build-essential snmp libnet-snmp-perl gettext


**2. Downloading the source**  

With the prerequisites installed, we can install Nagios itself. Download the source code for the latest stable release of Nagios Core.

    $ cd /tmp
    $ wget -O nagioscore.tar.gz https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/archive/nagios-4.4.5.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf nagioscore.tar.gz


**3. Compile source and install Nagios**  

Before building Nagios, run the configure script and specify the Apache configs directory:

    $ cd /tmp/nagioscore-nagios-4.4.5/
    $ sudo ./configure --with-httpd-conf=/etc/apache2/sites-enabled

We will see the following output from the configure command:

    *** Configuration summary for nagios 4.4.5 2019-08-20 ***:
    
    General Options:
    -------------------------
            Nagios executable:  nagios
            Nagios user/group:  nagios,nagios
        Command user/group:  nagios,nagios
                Event Broker:  yes
            Install ${prefix}:  /usr/local/nagios
        Install ${includedir}:  /usr/local/nagios/include/nagios
                    Lock file:  /run/nagios.lock
    Check result directory:  /usr/local/nagios/var/spool/checkresults
            Init directory:  /lib/systemd/system
    Apache conf.d directory:  /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
                Mail program:  /usr/sbin/sendmail
                    Host OS:  linux-gnu
            IOBroker Method:  epoll
    
    Web Interface Options:
    ------------------------
                    HTML URL:  http://localhost/nagios/
                    CGI URL:  http://localhost/nagios/cgi-bin/
    Traceroute (used by WAP):  /usr/bin/traceroute


    Review the options above for accuracy.  If they look okay,
    type 'make all' to compile the main program and CGIs.

Now compile Nagios with this command:

    $ sudo make all

Next create a nagios user and nagios group. They will be used to run the Nagios process:

    $ sudo make install-groups-users
    $ sudo usermod -a -G nagios www-data

Now run these make commands to install Nagios binary files, service files, and its sample configuration files:

    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo make install-daemoninit
    $ sudo make install-commandmode
    $ sudo make install-config

We will use Apache to serve Nagios’ web interface, so run the following to install the Apache configuration files and configure its settings:

    $ sudo make install-webconf

Enable the Apache rewrite and cgi modules with the a2enmod command:

    $ sudo a2enmod rewrite
    $ sudo a2enmod cgi

Now need to create an Apache user account to be able to log into Nagios.

The following command will create a user account called `nagiosadmin` and will be prompted to provide a password for the account.

    $ sudo htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin

Please enter `training` as password at the prompt. Remember this password, as we will need it to access the Nagios web interface.

Restart Apache to load the new Apache configuration:

    $ sudo systemctl restart apache2

Nagios is now running, to confirm this you need to log into the Nagios Web Interface. Point the web browser to the ip address or FQDN of your Nagios Core server, for example:

**_If you are doing the lab on-line/remote, refer to the lab access guide for instructions on creating a tunnel with ssh_**

`http://groupX-server.apnictraining.net/nagios`

Will be prompted for a username and password. The username is `nagiosadmin` and the password is `training`


We have only installed the Nagios Core engine. But for this to work, it is necessary to install the Nagios Plugins, which you’ll cover in the next step.

**4. Installing the Nagios Plugins**  

Nagios needs plugins to operate properly. The official Nagios Plugins package contains over 50 plugins that allow you to monitor basic services such as uptime, disk usage, swap usage, NTP, and others.

Download and extract the archive

    $ cd /tmp
    $ wget --no-check-certificate -O nagios-plugins.tar.gz \
    https://github.com/nagios-plugins/nagios-plugins/\
    /releases/download/release-2.4.0/nagios-plugins-2.4.0.tar.gz  

Compile and install:

    $ tar zxfv nagios-plugins.tar.gz
    $ cd /tmp/nagios-plugins-release-2.4.0/
    $ sudo ./configure
    $ sudo make
    $ sudo make install

Now start `nagios` service

    $ sudo systemctl restart nagios

**_If you are doing the lab on-line/remote, refer to the lab access guide for instructions on creating a tunnel with ssh_**

Point your web browser to the ip address or FQDN of your Nagios Core server, for example:

`http://groupX-server.apnictraining.net/nagios`

Go to a host and check the status of `localhost`.

**5. Configuring Nagios**    

Now let’s perform the initial Nagios configuration, which involves editing some configuration files.

Open the main Nagios configuration file and find the line `#cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers`

    $ sudo vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

Uncomment this line by deleting the # character from the front of the line:

    cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers

also uncomment the line `#cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/routers`

Now create the directory that will store the configuration file for each server that you will monitor:

    $ sudo mkdir /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers
    $ sudo mkdir /usr/local/nagios/etc/routers



**6. Monitoring Hosts with Nagios**  

To monitor any hosts with Nagios, we will add configuration files for each host specifying what we want to monitor.

On the Nagios server, create a new configuration file for each of the remote hosts that we want to monitor in `/usr/local/nagios/etc/routers/`. The following example is to monitor `core-router.apnictraining.net`

    $ sudo vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/routers/core-router.cfg

Add the following host definition:

    define host {
            use                             generic-host
            host_name                       core-router
            alias                           core-router
            address                         core-router.apnictraining.net
            check_command                   check-host-alive
            max_check_attempts              5
            check_period                    24x7
            notification_interval           30
            notification_period             24x7
    }

Restart the Nagios service to put any changes into effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart nagios

After several minutes, Nagios will check the new hosts.

Lets add few more nodes and start monitoring them.

Following configuration is for `core-switch`:  

    $ sudo vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/core-switch.cfg
    
    define host {
            use                             generic-host
            host_name                       core-switch
            alias                           core-switch
            address                         core-switch.apnictraining.net
            check_command                   check-host-alive
            max_check_attempts              5
            check_period                    24x7
            notification_interval           30
            notification_period             24x7
    }

Now add your group router `groupX-router`. Replace `X` with group number:

    $ sudo vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/routers/groupX-router.cfg
    
    define host {
            use                             generic-host
            host_name                       groupX-router
            alias                           groupX-router
            address                         groupX-router.apnictraining.net
            check_command                   check-host-alive
            max_check_attempts              5
            check_period                    24x7
            notification_interval           30
            notification_period             24x7
    }

Restart the Nagios service to put any changes into effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart nagios

Go to Nagios web interface and validate.

**7. Monitoring Services with Nagios**  

In previous step we have configured Nagios to monitor the uptime. Nagios will only tell if the host is up or down. Let’s add some services to monitor.

Following configuration is to monitor `group1-server.apnictraining.net` HTTP service:

    $ sudo vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/group1-server.cfg

Add the following host definition:

    define host {
        use         generic-host
        host_name   group1-server
        alias       group1-server
        address     group1-server.apnictraining.net
        check_command                   check-host-alive
        max_check_attempts              5
        check_period                    24x7
        notification_interval           30
        notification_period             24x7
    }
    
    define service {
        use                 generic-service
        host_name           group1-server
        service_description HTTP
        check_command       check_http
    }

The use `generic-service` directive tells Nagios to inherit the values of a service template called `generic-service`, which is predefined by Nagios.

Restart the Nagios service to put any changes into effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart nagios

From Nagios web interface go to `Services` tab and verify.

We can add other hosts (servers and routers) and start monitoring them.

**8. Adding Parent Relationships**  

The keyword `parents` define the parent-child relationship between nodes. For example as per our lab topology below is the connectivity diagram:  

    groupX-server -> groupX-router -> core-switch -> core-router

Where `core-router` is parent of `core-switch` and `core-switch` is parent of `groupX-router`

We can update our nodes configuration accordingly.

`core-switch.cfg`:

    define host {
            use                             generic-host
            host_name                       core-switch
            alias                           core-switch
            address                         core-switch.apnictraining.net
            check_command                   check-host-alive
            max_check_attempts              5
            check_period                    24x7
            notification_interval           30
            notification_period             24x7
            parents                         core-router
    }


`groupX-router.cfg` [replace X with group number]:

    define host {
            use                             generic-host
            host_name                       groupX-router
            alias                           groupX-router
            address                         groupX-router.apnictraining.net
            check_command                   check-host-alive
            max_check_attempts              5
            check_period                    24x7
            notification_interval           30
            notification_period             24x7
            parents                         core-switch
    }

`groupX-server.cfg` [replace X with group number]:

    define host {
            use                             generic-host
            host_name                       groupX-server
            alias                           groupX-server
            address                         groupX-server.apnictraining.net
            check_command                   check-host-alive
            max_check_attempts              5
            check_period                    24x7
            notification_interval           30
            notification_period             24x7
            parents                         core-switch
    }

Restart the Nagios service to put any changes into effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart nagios

Please confirm `nagios` has been loaded properly.

    $ sudo systemctl status nagios

If `nagios` service is broken please check `/usr/local/nagios/var/nagios.log` for more details.

From Nagios web interface go to `Map` tab and verify.

Clean up after our installs
```
$ cd /tmp
$ sudo rm -rf *
```

**End of Lab**
