# LAB: RRDTool Lab - SmokePing 


#### Please follow the lab guide to login to the VM.

**Note:**  
 
* Commands preceded with `$` imply that you should execute the command as a general user - not as root.
* Commands preceded with `#` imply that you should be working as root.
* If a command line ends with `\` this indicates that the command continues on the next line and you should treat this as a single line.

**1. Install Required Packages**  

Update the package index for the APT package manager and install necessary packages:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install fcgiwrap smokeping nginx # choose "Internet Site" for postfix configuration 
```    
We will now need to create the NGINX Configuration

Using an editor of your choice create the following file `/etc/nginx/conf.d/smokeping.conf`
<BR>
_**DON'T forget to update the server name (Use your OOB IP Address)**_
```
server {
        listen 81;
        listen [::]:81;
        server_name YOUR_SERVER_NAME_HERE;


        location = /smokeping/smokeping.cgi {
                fastcgi_intercept_errors on;

                fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME         /usr/lib/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi;
                fastcgi_param   QUERY_STRING            $query_string;
                fastcgi_param   REQUEST_METHOD          $request_method;
                fastcgi_param   CONTENT_TYPE            $content_type;
                fastcgi_param   CONTENT_LENGTH          $content_length;
                fastcgi_param   REQUEST_URI             $request_uri;
                fastcgi_param   DOCUMENT_URI            $document_uri;
                fastcgi_param   DOCUMENT_ROOT           $document_root;
                fastcgi_param   SERVER_PROTOCOL         $server_protocol;
                fastcgi_param   GATEWAY_INTERFACE       CGI/1.1;
                fastcgi_param   SERVER_SOFTWARE         nginx/$nginx_version;
                fastcgi_param   REMOTE_ADDR             $remote_addr;
                fastcgi_param   REMOTE_PORT             $remote_port;
                fastcgi_param   SERVER_ADDR             $server_addr;
                fastcgi_param   SERVER_PORT             $server_port;
                fastcgi_param   SERVER_NAME             $server_name;
                fastcgi_param   HTTPS                   $https if_not_empty;

                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket;
        }

        location ^~ /smokeping/ {
                alias /usr/share/smokeping/www/;
                index smokeping.cgi;
                gzip off;
        }

        location / {
                return 301 http://$server_name/smokeping/smokeping.cgi;
        }
}
```


**2. Access web interface**  

Visit `http://172.18.X.X:81/smokeping/smokeping.cgi` to access the web interface. By default it will add the local machine as target. Replace `X` with group/host number.


**3. Edit configuration files and add target**  

Go to the SmokePing configuration folder:
```
$ cd /etc/smokeping/config.d
```
It has the following files:

    config.d/  
    ├── Alerts          
    ├── Database  
    ├── General
    ├── pathnames
    ├── Presentation
    ├── Probes
    ├── Slaves
    └── Targets

Edit `General` and set your name and contact details. Also adjust ‘Alerts’ to send the contact addresses for notifications to be sent to.

Now open the `Target` file and add the following at the end of the file:
```bash
+ Internet
menu = Internet
title = Internet

++ Google
host = www.google.com

++ Yahoo
host = www.yahoo.com

+ NMMLab
menu = NMMLab
title = NMMLab

++ CoreRouter
host = core-router.apnictraining.net

++ CoreSwitch
host = core-switch.apnictraining.net
```

This will add `Internet` & `NMMLab` section and monitor related host define in the config file. 

Any time we make a change to these files, we will need to save and then run the following to update the running configuration.
```
$ sudo systemctl restart smokeping
```

Now refresh the browser tab and wait for data to accumulate.

The RRD files are created under `/var/lib/smokeping` folder:
```bash
$ ls -lah /var/lib/smokeping/Internet/
drwxr-xr-x 2 smokeping smokeping    4 Dec  4 01:58 .
drwxr-xr-x 8 smokeping smokeping    8 Dec  4 01:58 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 smokeping smokeping 2.9M Dec  4 02:28 Google.rrd
-rw-r--r-- 1 smokeping smokeping 2.9M Dec  4 02:28 Yahoo.rrd

You can start adding other groups server / router and start monitoring them.

**4. Add new Probe** 

In previous exercise we have used `FPing` probe. It's possible to add other probes. In this exercise we will use DNS probe.

***4.1 Create DNS Probe***   

Edit `/etc/smokeping/config.d/Probes` and add the probe details:
```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/smokeping/config.d/Probes
```

Add the following config:
```bash
+ DNS
binary = /usr/bin/dig
lookup = core-router.apnictraining.net
pings = 5
step = 180
```

***4.2 Add Target***  

To add new target(s) we add details in the `Targets` file.
```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/smokeping/config.d/Targets
```

Add the following config at the end of the file:
```bash
+ DNS
probe = DNS
menu = DNS latency

++ DNS01
title = dns01.apnictraining.net
host = dns01.apnictraining.net

++ DNS02
title = dns02.apnictraining.net
host = dns02.apnictraining.net
```

Save the file and exit.

***4.3 Restart SmokePing***  
```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart smokeping
```
Now refresh the browser tab and wait for data to accumulate.
