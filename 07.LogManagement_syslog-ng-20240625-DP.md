**Note:**  
 
* Commands preceded with `$` imply that you should execute the command as a general user - not as root.
* Commands preceded with `#` imply that you should be working as root.
* If a command line ends with `\` this indicates that the command continues on the next line and you should treat this as a single line.

**1. Install syslog-ng**  

Update the package index for the APT package manager and install `syslog-ng`:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install syslog-ng
```

Verify installed version of syslog-ng:
```bash
$ syslog-ng --version
syslog-ng 3 (3.35.1)
Config version: 3.35
Installer-Version: 3.35.1
--- snip ---
Enable-Memtrace: off
Enable-IPv6: on
Enable-Spoof-Source: on
Enable-TCP-Wrapper: on
Enable-Linux-Caps: on
Enable-Systemd: on
```


**2. Configure syslog-ng**  

The default configuration file is `/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf`. To allow logs from another machine or device we need to do the following changes:  
```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
```

Find the lines:
```bash
source s_src {
    system();
    internal();
};
```

Add `udp();` and it will look like below:
```bash
source s_src {
    system();
    internal();
    udp();
};
```

Save the file and exit.

Since the last line in the `syslog-ng.conf` config file (`/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf`) is `@include "/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/"`, all configuration files in the folder `conf.d` will be processed, too.
```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/router.conf

filter f_routers { facility(local0); };

log {
    source(s_src);
    filter(f_routers);
    destination(routers);
};

destination routers {
    file("/var/log/apnic/$HOST/$YEAR/$MONTH/$HOST-$YEAR-$MONTH-$DAY.log"
    owner(root) group(root) perm(0644) dir_perm(0755) create_dirs(yes)
    template("$YEAR $DATE $HOST $MSG\n"));
};    
```

As all the logs will be stored in `/var/log/apnic`; we need to create the folder:
```bash
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/log/apnic
```

Restart syslog-ng:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart syslog-ng
```
Check the status
```bash
$ sudo systemctl status syslog-ng

```

The default port for syslog is `udp/514`; we can check the same from `netstat` command:
```bash
$ sudo netstat -4altunp|grep 514
udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:514             0.0.0.0:*                           5685/syslog-ng
```

<br>

**3. Configure router to send syslog**  

Login to your group router and add the following configuration. Replace `X` with your group number:
```
(config)# logging 192.168.X.10
(config)# logging facility local0
(config)# logging userinfo
(config)# exit
# write memory
```
Run `show logging` to verify
```bash
Trap logging: level informational, 60 message lines logged
    Logging to 192.168.X.10  (udp port 514, audit disabled,
            link up),
            14 message lines logged,
            0 message lines rate-limited,
            0 message lines dropped-by-MD,
            xml disabled, sequence number disabled
            filtering disabled
    Logging Source-Interface:       VRF Name:

Log Buffer (8192 bytes):
```

Logs are stored in `/var/log/apnic/` folder. There will be folder for each host. If you hvae noticed the log location is defined in the `/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/router.conf` file which is `/var/log/apnic/$HOST/$YEAR/$MONTH/$HOST-$YEAR-$MONTH-$DAY.log`. 

    $ more /var/log/apnic/192.168.10.1/2020/12/192.168.10.1-2020-12-28.log
