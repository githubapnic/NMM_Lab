# LAB: RRDTool Lab - SmokePing 


#### Please follow the lab guide to login to the VM.

**Note:**  
 
* Commands preceded with `$` imply that you should execute the command as a general user - not as root.
* Commands preceded with `#` imply that you should be working as root.
* If a command line ends with `\` this indicates that the command continues on the next line and you should treat this as a single line.

**1. Install Required Packages**  

Update the package index for the APT package manager and install necessary packages:

    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
    $ sudo apt-get install smokeping # choose "Internet Site" for postfix configuration 
    $ sudo apt-get install apache2
    $ sudo a2enmod cgi
    $ sudo service apache2 restart
    


**2. Access web interface**  

Visit `http://groupX-server.apnictraining.net/smokeping/smokeping.cgi` to access the web interface. By default it will add the local machine as target. Replace `X` with group number.


**3. Edit configuration files and add target**  

Go to the SmokePing configuration folder:

    $ cd /etc/smokeping/config.d

It has the following files:

    config.d/  
    ├── Alerts          
    ├── Database  
    ├── General
    ├── pathnames
    ├── Presentation
    ├── Probes
    ├── Slaves
    └── Targets

Edit `General` and set your name and contact details. Also adjust ‘Alerts’ to send the contact addresses for notifications to be sent to.

Now open the `Target` file and add the following at the end of the file:

    + Internet
    menu = Internet
    title = Internet

    ++ Google
    host = www.google.com

    ++ Yahoo
    host = www.yahoo.com

    + NMMLab
    menu = NMMLab
    title = NMMLab

    ++ CoreRouter
    host = core-router.apnictraining.net

    ++ CoreSwitch
    host = core-switch.apnictraining.net


This will add `Internet` & `NMMLab` section and monitor related host define in the config file. 

Any time we make a change to these files, we will need to save and then run the following to update the running configuration.

    $ sudo systemctl restart smokeping

Now refresh the browser tab and wait for data to accumulate.

The RRD files are created under `/var/lib/smokeping` folder:

    $ ls -lah /var/lib/smokeping/Internet/
    drwxr-xr-x 2 smokeping smokeping    4 Dec  4 01:58 .
    drwxr-xr-x 8 smokeping smokeping    8 Dec  4 01:58 ..
    -rw-r--r-- 1 smokeping smokeping 2.9M Dec  4 02:28 Google.rrd
    -rw-r--r-- 1 smokeping smokeping 2.9M Dec  4 02:28 Yahoo.rrd

You can start adding other groups server / router and start monitoring them.

**4. Add new Probe** 

In previous exercise we have used `FPing` probe. It's possible to add other probes. In this exercise we will use DNS probe.

***4.1 Create DNS Probe***   

Edit `/etc/smokeping/config.d/Probes` and add the probe details:

    $ sudo vi /etc/smokeping/config.d/Probes

Add the following config:

    + DNS
    binary = /usr/bin/dig
    lookup = core-router.apnictraining.net
    pings = 5
    step = 180

***4.2 Add Target***  

To add new target(s) we add details in the `Targets` file.

    $ sudo vi /etc/smokeping/config.d/Targets

Add the following config at the end of the file:

    + DNS
    probe = DNS
    menu = DNS latency

    ++ DNS01
    title = dns01.apnictraining.net
    host = dns01.apnictraining.net

    ++ DNS02
    title = dns02.apnictraining.net
    host = dns02.apnictraining.net

Save the file and exit.

***4.3 Restart SmokePing***  

    $ sudo systemctl restart smokeping

Now refresh the browser tab and wait for data to accumulate.
