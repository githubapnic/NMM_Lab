# LAB: SNMP Lab - NetSNMP 

#### Please follow the lab guide to login to the VM.
<br>
**Note:**  
 
* Commands preceded with `$` imply that you should execute the command as a general user - not as root.
* Commands preceded with `#` imply that you should be working as root.
* If a command line ends with `\` this indicates that the command continues on the next line and you should treat this as a single line.
<br>
<br>

**1. Installing the SNMP Daemon and Utilities**  
Update the package index for the APT package manager:

    $ sudo apt update

Next, install the SNMP software:  

	$ sudo apt install snmpd snmp snmp-mibs-downloader

The snmp package provides a collection of command line tools for issuing SNMP requests to agents. The snmp-mibs-downloader package will help to install and manage Management Information Base (MIB) files, which keep track of network objects.  

<br>  

**2. Configuring the SNMP Manager Server**   
Open the /etc/snmp/snmp.conf file in your text editor with sudo privileges:

	$ sudo vi /etc/snmp/snmp.conf

In this file, there are a few comments and a single un-commented line. To allow the manager to import the MIB files, comment out the `mibs :` line:

    # As the snmp packages come without MIB files due to license reasons, loading
    # of MIBs is disabled by default. If you added the MIBs you can reenable
    # loading them by commenting out the following line.
    #mibs :
 
Save and close `snmp.conf`  

<br>

**3. Configuring the SNMP Agent Server**  

In the lab we are using same server for Manager Server and Agent Server. Open the daemonâ€™s configuration file with sudo privileges:

	$ sudo vi /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

First, we need to change the agentAddress directive. Currently, it is set to only allow connections originating from the local computer. We will need to comment out the current line, and uncomment the line underneath, which allows all connections.

    #  Listen for connections from the local system only
    #agentAddress  udp:127.0.0.1:161
    #  Listen for connections on all interfaces (both IPv4 *and* IPv6)
    agentAddress udp:161,udp6:[::1]:161

Under `ACCESS CONTROL` section add the following line:

    rocommunity training  192.168.0.0/16

This will allow 192.168.0.0/16 network to do SNMP queries with community `training` 

Additionally we can change `SYSTEM INFORMATION` section also

    sysLocation    Brisbane, Australia
    sysContact     training@apnic.net

Note that for any changes to the configuration file to take effect, force the snmpd service to stop and start or reload the configuration by running the following command(s):

    $ sudo systemctl stop snmpd
    $ sudo systemctl status snmpd
    $ sudo systemctl start snmpd

If we can check, SNMP is now listening:

    apnic@group10-server:~$ sudo netstat -nlpu|grep snmp

```bash 
    udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:161             0.0.0.0:*
    udp6       0      0 ::1:161                 :::*
```

<br>

**4. Test SNMP**  

Now run the following command and check the output

    $ snmpwalk -v2c -c training 192.168.10.10

The `snmpwalk` command essentially performs a whole series of getnexts automatically for us, and stops when it returns results that are no longer inside the range of the OID that you originally specified.

If we wanted to get all of the information stored on a machine in the system MIB group, for instance, we could use this command to do so:

    $ snmpwalk -v2c -c training 192.168.10.10 system

sample output    
```bash 
SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0 = STRING: Linux group10-server 4.15.0-118-generic #119-Ubuntu SMP Tue Sep 8 12:30:01 UTC 2020 x86_64
SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID.0 = OID: NET-SNMP-MIB::netSnmpAgentOIDs.10
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (3449855) 9:34:58.55
SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0 = STRING: training@apnic.net
SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: group10-server
SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation.0 = STRING: Brisbane, Australia
SNMPv2-MIB::sysServices.0 = INTEGER: 72
SNMPv2-MIB::sysORLastChange.0 = Timeticks: (1) 0:00:00.01
SNMPv2-MIB::sysORID.1 = OID: SNMP-MPD-MIB::snmpMPDCompliance
SNMPv2-MIB::sysORID.2 = OID: SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmMIBCompliance
SNMPv2-MIB::sysORID.3 = OID: SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB::snmpFrameworkMIBCompliance
```

Or if you want you can get the system uptime only:

    $ snmpwalk -v2c -c training 192.168.10.10 sysUpTime

sample output
```bash 
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (3456431) 9:36:04.31
```

The snmpget command can be used to retrieve data from a remote host given its host name, authentication information and an OID. As a simple example:

    $ snmpget -v 2c -c training 192.168.10.10 system.sysUpTime.0

sample output
```bash 
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (3456431) 9:36:04.31
```

<br>

**5. Configure SNMP - Cisco**  

Login to the group router. 

    $ ssh apnic@192.168.xx.1 # replace xx with group number

_**If you receive an error about Key Exchange Methods, do the following**_
```
$ sudo -i 
<< Enter sudo password if required >>
```
Copy and paste this block as it appears:

```
cat <<EOF>> /etc/ssh/ssh_config
KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group1-sha1,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
HostKeyAlgorithms = +ssh-rsa
PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms = +ssh-rsa
EOF
exit
 
```


Type the following command (after #) and enable snmp.

```
group10-router> enable
Password: training
group10-router#config t
group10-router(config)#access-list 99 permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
group10-router(config)#snmp-server community training ro 99
group10-router(config)#exit
group10-router#wr
```

This will enable SNMP with community `training`. Network 192.168.0.0/16 can only do the SNMP query which is defined in access control list 99.

Now run the same `snmpwalk` command but point it to the router

    $ snmpwalk -v2c -c training 192.168.10.1

sample output
```bash 
SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0 = STRING: Cisco IOS Software, IOSv Software (VIOS-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.6(1)T, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID.0 = OID: SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.1.1041
DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (8897506) 1 day, 0:42:55.06

```

Like to see how many interfaces are there? Try the following `snmpwalk` command:

    $ snmpwalk -v 2c -c training 192.168.10.1 IfName

sample output
```bash 
IF-MIB::ifName.1 = STRING: Gi0/0
IF-MIB::ifName.2 = STRING: Gi0/1
IF-MIB::ifName.3 = STRING: Gi0/2
IF-MIB::ifName.4 = STRING: Gi0/3
IF-MIB::ifName.5 = STRING: Nu0
```
